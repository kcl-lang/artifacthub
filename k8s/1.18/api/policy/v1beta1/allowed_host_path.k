schema AllowedHostPath:
    """
    AllowedHostPath defines the host volume conditions that will be enabled by a policy for pods to use. It requires the path prefix to be defined.

    Attributes
    ----------
    pathPrefix : str, default is Undefined, optional
        pathPrefix is the path prefix that the host volume must match. It does not support `*`. Trailing slashes are trimmed when validating the path prefix with a host path.

        Examples: `/foo` would allow `/foo`, `/foo/` and `/foo/bar` `/foo` would not allow `/food` or `/etc/foo`
    readOnly : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        when set to true, will allow host volumes matching the pathPrefix only if all volume mounts are readOnly.
