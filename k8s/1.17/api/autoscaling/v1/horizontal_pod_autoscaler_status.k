    Attributes
    ----------
    currentCPUUtilizationPercentage : int, default is Undefined, optional
        current average CPU utilization over all pods, represented as a percentage of requested CPU, e.g. 70 means that an average pod is using now 70% of its requested CPU.
    currentReplicas : int, default is Undefined, required
        current number of replicas of pods managed by this autoscaler.
    desiredReplicas : int, default is Undefined, required
        desired number of replicas of pods managed by this autoscaler.
    lastScaleTime : str, default is Undefined, optional
        last time the HorizontalPodAutoscaler scaled the number of pods; used by the autoscaler to control how often the number of pods is changed.
    observedGeneration : int, default is Undefined, optional
        most recent generation observed by this autoscaler.
