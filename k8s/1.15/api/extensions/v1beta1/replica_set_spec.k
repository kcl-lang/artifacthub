    Attributes
    ----------
    minReadySeconds : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)
    replicas : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Replicas is the number of desired replicas. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and unspecified. Defaults to 1. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/#what-is-a-replicationcontroller
    selector : v1.LabelSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        Selector is a label query over pods that should match the replica count. If the selector is empty, it is defaulted to the labels present on the pod template. Label keys and values that must match in order to be controlled by this replica set. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors
    template : coreV1.PodTemplateSpec, default is Undefined, optional
        Template is the object that describes the pod that will be created if insufficient replicas are detected. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller#pod-template
