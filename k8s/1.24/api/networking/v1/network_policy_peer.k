    """
    NetworkPolicyPeer describes a peer to allow traffic to/from. Only certain combinations of fields are allowed

    Attributes
    ----------
    ipBlock : IPBlock, default is Undefined, optional
        IPBlock defines policy on a particular IPBlock. If this field is set then neither of the other fields can be.
    namespaceSelector : v1.LabelSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        Selects Namespaces using cluster-scoped labels. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects all namespaces.

        If PodSelector is also set, then the NetworkPolicyPeer as a whole selects the Pods matching PodSelector in the Namespaces selected by NamespaceSelector. Otherwise it selects all Pods in the Namespaces selected by NamespaceSelector.
    podSelector : v1.LabelSelector, default is Undefined, optional
        This is a label selector which selects Pods. This field follows standard label selector semantics; if present but empty, it selects all pods.

        If NamespaceSelector is also set, then the NetworkPolicyPeer as a whole selects the Pods matching PodSelector in the Namespaces selected by NamespaceSelector. Otherwise it selects the Pods matching PodSelector in the policy's own Namespace.
